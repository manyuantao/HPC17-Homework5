# HPC17-Homework5
Homework5, Serial multigrid implementation for 2D Jacobi.

## Compile
Type `make` in a terminal.

## Run jacobi2D-multigrid
Enter `./jacobi2D-multigrid Nfine max_iters [ssteps]`,

where `Nfine` is the number of intervals, must be power of 2, `max_iters` is the maximum number of iterations.
